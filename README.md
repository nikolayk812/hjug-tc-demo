# TestContainers demo

There are 2 services in this demo:

- User service
- Item service


*User service* uses *Postgres* and *Item service* uses *Redis* respectively and has dependency on User service. Each service has a SpringBootTest which uses non-mocked DB started by *TestContainers* library.  

*test-runner* module is an example of a framework to start all 2 services and their dependencies  together in order to perform end-to-end tests.
